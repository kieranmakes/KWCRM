### How It Works

* Electron app src/index.js creates a browser window and runs the express app
* Express app kwcrm-app/index.js directory serves the site to localhost:8000
* Electron browser window loads up localhost:8000

<br>

* All data is stored in text files and a CSVHandler class is used to handle the searching, sorting and manipulation of the files
* Very minimal node packages have been used as it was made for a school coursework initially, so I avoided node packages wherever I could to write the code myself
